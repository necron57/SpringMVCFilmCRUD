# Lessons Learned
As a team we learned how to better utilize Java with SQL to access a database to then create/update/delete info in that database based off userinput and then print that info to a dynamic webpage. One of the bigger challenges as team that we had to overcome was getting the film's info to be updated properly/having the film's existing info populate the update form, this was overcome by changing from using majority HTML pages/forms to majority JSP pages/forms which made changing what info was displayed much easier.
